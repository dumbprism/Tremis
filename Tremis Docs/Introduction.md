This section consists of what led to the idea of creating Tremis and also how is it different from relational databases.

### The idea

During my exploration of the many  databases in the market, **Redis** caught my  as an **in-memory storage solution** that functions on a key-value pair model. Its efficiency and simplicity overwhelmed me. 

So I surfed the internet and noticed that Redis was no longer fully open-source. 

### Tremis : A brief history

I was planning on starting my open source contributions but I saw an opportunity to create something of my own—**an open-source in-memory storage system with similar performance characteristics.** 

This led to the creation of **Tremis**. It's a project that draws inspiration from Redis but with its own unique approach and focus. Tremis is built using GoLang, designed to handle data efficiently and provide fast access to key-value pairs, making it an excellent fit for modern applications.

My journey with Tremis has been deeply rooted in the belief that continual learning and exploration are key to growth. With that in mind, I’ve also included sections to help others **build their own Tremis**, creating a community of developers who are eager to learn and innovate.
